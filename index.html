            data-about_me_text="I grew up in Calabasas, California, USA.
            I have lived in California, Massachusetts, Ohio, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan, as well as in Germany.
            <p>Currently I live with my family in the Detroit metropolitan area in Michigan, USA. I like superhero movies, 
            science fiction books, historical and geographical trivia, and scoring baseball games. I grew up a Dodgers fan, 
            but I am now a fully assimilated Tigers fan."
            data-motivic_homotopy_theory_text="My research revolves around the interaction between homotopy theory and algebra.
            One of my primary interests is motivic homotopy theory, which is a blend of classical homotopy theory and algebraic geometry.
            The basic goal of this subject is to solve problems in algebraic geometry using traditional methods of algebraic topology.
            <p>Currently, my main interest is a long-term project to make fundamental computations in motivic homotopy theory.
            This research is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. I work extensively with the motivic version
            of the Adams spectral sequence, especially over C and R. Massey products and Toda brackets are the essential computational
            tools that I use to deduce information about the behavior of this spectral sequence, and ultimately about stable homotopy groups.
            Computer calculations play a major role in this project. My collaborators on this project are Eva Belmont, Dan Dugger,
            Bogdan Gheorghe, Bert Guillou, Hana Kong, Achim Krause, Guozhen Wang, and Zhouli Xu."
            data-other_research_interests_text="In conjunction with Dan Dugger, I have generalized results about sums-of-squares
            formulas over fields of characteristic zero so that they apply over arbitrary fields of characteristic not equal to 2.
            The basic idea is to replace techniques involving cohomology theories for topological spaces with techniques involving
            algebraic cohomology theories.
            <p> I have also spent some time with Cayley-Dickson algebras. These are finite-dimensional
            non-associative algebras that generalize the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.
            In conjunction with Dan Dugger, Daniel Biss, and Dan Christensen, we have attempted to classify the zero-divisors in
            Cayley-Dickson algebras.
            <p> I used to be interested in abstract homotopy theory (i.e., model categories), especially
            with respect to homotopy theories for pro-objects.  However, I am no longer actively working on problems in this field."
            data-algebraic_topology_journals_text="One key to successfully publishing a research article is to submit your work to
            an editor whose mathematical interests are close to the topic of your submission.  This page lists the names of journals
            whose editorial board includes at least one algebraic topologist.  I have found this list to be very useful in deciding
            where to submit an article, and maybe others will find it helpful as well.  Please do not interpret this page as an
            endorsement or recommendation of any particular journal.
            <p> I compiled the list by searching through the editorial boards
            on journal websites. The selection criteria are somewhat arbitrary, so it is likely that there are mistakes and
            oversights.  Please send corrections or updates to Dan Isaksen at isaksen.dan@gmail.com.  Special thanks go to Bogdan
            Gheorghe and Gustavo Granja for their help in maintaining the list.  This page was last updated in April 2025."
