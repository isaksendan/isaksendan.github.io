            data-landing_text='My main research interest is to compute homotopy groups of spheres.  Various
            parts of this program have been supported by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science
            Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org">Simons Foundation</a>.  This page summarizes my research work for non-experts.  
            <p>Sometimes people (including mathematicians) ask how we are confident that our complicated, lengthy,
            and detailed computations are correct.  This is an excellent question that deserves careful
            consideration.  First of all, we rely on computer calculations whenever possible.  However,
            eventually we want to go beyond what can be verified by computer.
            <p>The different parts of the structure that we are calculating are linked in multiple complicated ways
            with each other.  As a result, when we make a mistake, inconsistencies typically arise quickly with
            other parts of the calculation.  This keeps us on the right track because the method itself catches
            many errors.
            <p>One possible analogy is to building a model of a ship.  Imagine having all of the parts of a
            kit for building a ship, but no instructions.  With enough patience and attention to detail,
            you might be able to figure out how to build the ship.  You might make mistakes along the way,
            which you can correct later when you realize that other parts will not fit.  In the end, if you have
            used all the parts, and the result floats in water, then you have probably built the model correctly.

            <p>I use a tool called the Adams spectral sequence to carry out these computations.  It is delicate,
            intricate, subtle, and complicated, but it is also understandable with enough insight and patience. 
            Each time we understand a new part of the machinery, another layer of complexities becomes accessible
            for further study.  By grappling with the difficulties of the Adams spectral sequence, we are widening
            human knowledge and developing new skills for thinking about abstract mathematics.  Very recently, we have
            begun to train computers to reason about spectral sequences as well.

            <p>Here is a quick introduction to the topic of my research, intended for undergraduate-educated scientists:
            <p><i>The geometric objects of interest in algebraic topology can be constructed by fitting together spheres of
            varying dimensions. The homotopy groups of spheres describe the ways in which spheres can be attached to
            each other. From the viewpoint of algebraic topology, detailed knowledge of these groups would lead to a
            classification of geometric objects. We summarize the state of previous knowledge of the stable homotopy
            groups of spheres through dimension 61 and provide information in dimensions 62 through 90. It is a highly
            counterintuitive fact that some high-dimensional spheres can be viewed in more than one way from the
            perspective of differentiability. We enumerate these differentiable structures through dimension 90,
            except for dimension 4.</i>

            For experts, I work extensively with various versions of the Adams spectral sequence, 
            in C-motivic, R-motivic, C2-equivariant, classical stable, and classical unstable contexts.
            Machines play an extensive role in carrying out these computations at scale.  Machines are used both
            to compute algebraically defined Adams E2-pages, but also to carry out large quantities of deductions about
            Adams differentials.  In this last regard, we are training computers to reason about spectral sequences.

            <p>Much of my work is supported by large machine computations.  In essence, the machine computations
            are specific linear algebra problems in very high dimensions.  The image below shows the reduced echelon
            form of a particular matrix of size 10127 x 11267.  For experts, it is the differential in a minimal
            resolution of the field F2 over the Steenrod algebra, in homological degree 6 and internal degree 100,
            with respect to a certain ordering on the Milnor basis.  Click the image to see a larger version.  I

            <p>Recently, we have been studying the structure of unstable homotopy groups of spheres.  We are using both the
            EHP-spectral sequence and the unstable Adams spectral sequence.  The image below is a small sample of the kinds of
            rich data that we have obtained.

            <p>Here is a historical image of a hand-written chart that I made, probably around 2010.  It shows the E4-page
            of the May spectral sequence in stems 52 through 70.  The stock is 17in x 22in quadruled paper, equal in size 
            to four letter sheets (approximately A2).  This handwritten technology has been replaced by computer
            technology that produces charts that are more legible, more accurate, and easier to use.  A non-mathematician
            friend once viewed this sheet and observed that the work was indistinguishable from the product of a 
            madman.

            an editor whose mathematical interests are close to the topic of your submission.  This page lists the names of journals
            whose editorial board includes at least one algebraic topologist.  I have found this list to be very useful in deciding
            where to submit an article, and maybe others will find it helpful as well.  Please do not interpret this page as an
            endorsement or recommendation of any particular journal.
            <p> I compiled the list by searching through the editorial boards
            on journal websites. The selection criteria are somewhat arbitrary, so it is likely that there are mistakes and
            oversights.  Please send corrections or updates to Dan Isaksen at isaksen.dan@gmail.com.  Special thanks go to Bogdan
